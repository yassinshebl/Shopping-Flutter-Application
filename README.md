# 🛍️ Flutter Shopping Demo Application

A small Flutter shopping/demo app (mobile + web) built with Flutter SDK (Dart >= 3.9).
This app demonstrates Material 3 UI, bilingual support, local assets, and simple routing in a self-contained, UI-first project.

# 📖 Project Overview

The app demonstrates:

- 🎨 Material 3 UI with a custom Suwannaphum font

- 📂 Local sample data for products, featured images, and offers

- 🧭 Basic routing & navigation (welcome, signup, signin, home, userinfo)

- 🌐 Bilingual UI (English / Arabic) with LTR ↔ RTL switching

- 🗄️ No backend — data is local, UI-focused demo

# 📁 **`lib/`** — File Mapping & Responsibilities
## Main Entry

- **`main.dart`**  
  - App entrypoint → `MyApp` StatefulWidget manages `_locale` and `_toggleLocale`  
  - Defines `MaterialApp` theme, `locale`, `supportedLocales`, `localizationsDelegates`, and routes  
  - Routes: `/`, `/signup`, `/signin`, `/home`, `/userinfo`  

## Data & Models

- **`product.dart`** → `Product` model (id, title, image)  
- **`sample_products.dart`** → sample local data:  
  - `featuredImages` → featured carousel images  
  - `products` → generated list of `Product`  
  - `hotOffers` → sample offers with `image` + `desc`  

## Screens

- **`welcome_screen.dart`** → landing screen (Sign Up / Sign In, language toggle)  
- **`home_screen.dart`** → product grid, featured `PageView`, offers list, Drawer (locale toggle, user info, logout)  
- **`signup_screen.dart`**, **`signin_screen.dart`**, **`user_info_screen.dart`** → authentication & user details  

## Widgets

- **`product_card.dart`** → UI card for product (image, title, add-to-cart → SnackBar placeholder)  
- **`offer_item.dart`** → UI card for offer (image + description)  

## Localization

- Generated: **`app_localizations.dart`**, **`app_localizations_en.dart`**, **`app_localizations_ar.dart`**  
- `.arb` source files should exist under **`l10n/`** (check `app_en.arb` if regeneration needed)  


# 🎨 Assets & Fonts

- Declared in **`pubspec.yaml`**  
- Assets:  
  - Featured images → `feat1.png`, …  
  - Products → `p1.png`, …  
  - Offers → `o1.png`, …  
- Fonts: **Suwannaphum** family (multiple weights), applied via `ThemeData.fontFamily`  

# 🌐 Localization

- Uses **`AppLocalizations`** (generated by Flutter)  
- Supported locales: **English (`en`)** and **Arabic (`ar`)**  
- Screens wrapped in `Directionality` for **RTL/LTR flipping**  

# 📦 Dependencies

From **`pubspec.yaml`**:

- **flutter** (sdk)  
- **flutter_localizations** (sdk)  
- **intl**  
- **cupertino_icons**  
- Dev: **flutter_test**, **flutter_lints**  

# 🚀 How to Run

Run from repo root:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

To target a specific device:
```bash
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
```
# ✅ Mini Contract (Inputs / Outputs / Success)

- **Inputs** → None external (local assets + sample_products.dart)

- **Outputs** →

  - Product grid

  - Featured carousel

  - Offers list

  - SnackBar placeholder on add-to-cart

  - Locale toggle (en/ar) with UI flipping

- Success →

  - App launches without missing assets
